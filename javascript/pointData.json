Possession limit of five nonnative fish in combination, only one of which can be a brown trout.

There is no possession limit on nonnative fish caught in the park with the following exceptions; waters above Lewis Falls, Lewis Lake, Lewis Channel and Shoshone Lake and its tributaries. Possession limit of five nonnative fish in combination, only one of which can be a brown trout.<br><br>Lake trout are an invasive species that are present in Shoshone, Lewis, Yellowstone and Heart lakes. Unfortunately their introduction to these Yellowstone fisheries has greatly impacted the native cutthroat population within the park's larger bodies of water. This has lead to a significant eradication program within the park designed to eliminate this non-native fish in the hopes of saving another. By comparison lake trout are significantly larger than the native species of cutthroat trout and may consume as many as 50 cutthroats in a year.<br><br>In an ongoing effort to protect the native cutthroat populations the park service requires that all lake trout be destroyed if caught in Yellowstone Lake. If you're fishing in the backcountry you must dispose of all fish entrails in fast moving or deep water. Do not leave fish carcasses along beaches or river banks because they will attract bears and other wildlife. If you should catch a lake trout the best method for disposal is to puncture the air bladder which lies behind the head and below the dorsal fin. After performing this procedure simply drop the trout back into the lake. If fishing from a shoreline consider weighting the fish and throwing it back into deeper water",
